# OpenNourish
OpenNourish is a free and open source food tracker.

## Installation

1. **Download the USDA FoodData Central dataset:**
   - Go to the [USDA FoodData Central download page](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets.html).
   - Download the latest "FoodData Central, April 2025: All data" dataset (or a newer version if available).
   - Unzip the downloaded FoodData_Central_csv_2025-04-24.zip file.

2. **Organize the data files:**
   - Create a folder named `usda_data` in the root of the OpenNourish project directory.
   - From the unzipped USDA dataset, copy all CSV files into the `usda_data` folder.

3. **Set up the environment and install dependencies:**
   - It is recommended to use a Conda environment:
     ```bash
     conda create --name opennourish python=3.9
     conda activate opennourish
     ```
   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Create a `.env` file:**
    - In the project root, create a file named `.env`.
    - Add the following line to this file, replacing the placeholder with a strong, random key:
      ```
      SECRET_KEY='a_very_strong_and_random_secret_key'
      ```
    - You can generate a secure key using Python:
      ```python
      import secrets
      secrets.token_hex(16)
      ```

5. **Install Typst:**
   - Typst is an external dependency required for generating nutrition labels. Follow the installation instructions on the official Typst website: [https://typst.app/docs/getting-started/](https://typst.app/docs/getting-started/)
   - **Note:** The snapd version of Typst may have limitations. Refer to the "Typst PDF Generation Issues" in the Troubleshooting section for more details.

6. **Install Liberation Sans Font:**
   - Ensure the Liberation Sans font is installed on your system. This font is used for generating nutrition labels. On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, you can install it using:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y fonts-liberation
     ```
     For other operating systems, please refer to your system's documentation for font installation.

6. **Create and populate the database:**
   - Run the import script to build the `usda_data.db` file from the USDA data. This may take a few minutes.
     ```bash
     python import_usda_data.py [--keep_newest_upc_only]
     ```
   - The `--keep_newest_upc_only` flag (optional) will ensure that if multiple food entries share the same UPC, only the one with the most recent `available_date` is imported. By default, all entries with duplicate UPCs will be imported.
   - Run `flask init-user-db` to initialize the `user_data.db`.

7. **Run the Flask application:**
   - Start the web server:
     ```bash
     flask run
     ```
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to use the application.

## Docker Setup

OpenNourish is designed for a fully automated setup using Docker. The container handles everything from downloading data to initializing databases on the first run.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Docker and Docker Compose:** Ensure Docker and Docker Compose (v2.x, using `docker compose` command) are installed on your system.
2.  **`.env` file:** In the project root, create a file named `.env` and add your `SECRET_KEY`.
    ```
    SECRET_KEY='a_very_strong_and_random_secret_key'
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Navigate to the project root directory.**
3.  **Start the application:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

**Note:** The first time you run the container, it will automatically download and process the entire USDA dataset, which may take several minutes depending on your system. Subsequent startups will be instant.

### Accessing the Application

The application will be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:8081`.

### Stopping the Application

To stop the running containers, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where compose is running, or run:
```bash
docker compose down
```

## Troubleshooting

### Typst PDF Generation Issues
If you encounter errors when generating nutrition labels (e.g., "input file not found"), ensure that your `typst` installation is not the snapd version. The snapd version of `typst` may have restrictions that prevent it from accessing files outside of your home directory, which can cause issues with temporary files generated by the application. It is recommended to install `typst` directly from its official releases or a package manager that does not impose such restrictions.
